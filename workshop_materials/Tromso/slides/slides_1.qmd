# Distance Sampling

## Overview of Distance Sampling {.smaller background-color="#FFFFFF"}

-   Distance sampling is a family of related methods for estimating the abundance and spatial distribution of wild populations.

-   Distance sampling is based on the idea that animals further away from observers are harder to detect than animals that are nearer.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   This idea is implemented in the model as a detection function that depends on distance.

    -   Animals at greater distances are harder to detect and the detection function therefore declines as distance increases.

## Density surface models {.smaller auto-animate="true" background-color="#FFFFFF"}

Coupling distance sampling data with spatial modelling allows maps of spatially varying density to be produced.

-   Traditionally, this is achieved in a two-stages approach by (i) using a detectability point estimates to create an offset vector to (ii) use within GLM or GAM for count response data.

## Density surface models {.smaller auto-animate="true" background-color="#FFFFFF"}

-   Traditionally, this is achieved in a two-stages approach by (i) using a detectability point estimates to create an offset vector to (ii) use within GLM or GAM for count response data.

-   This requires binning the data into counts based on some discretisation of space.

## Density surface models {.smaller auto-animate="true" background-color="#FFFFFF"}

Coupling distance sampling data with spatial modelling allows maps of spatially varying density to be produced.

-   Traditionally, this is achieved in a two-stages approach by (i) using a detectability point estimates to create an offset vector to (ii) use within GLM or GAM for count response data.

-   A major downside to this approach is the **propagation of uncertainty** from the detection model to the second-stage spatial model.

::: fragment
-   **The goal**: one-stage distance sampling model, simultaneously estimating the detectability and the spatial distribution of animals using a *point process framework*.

# Point Processes

## Point process data {.smaller background-color="#FFFFFF"}

::: {style="height: 50px;"}
:::

Many of the ecological and environmental processes of interest can be represented by a spatial point process or can be view as an aggregation of one.

![](figures/frompontsto.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

-   Many contemporary data sources collect georeferenced information about the location where an event has occur (e.g., species occurrence, wildfire, flood events).
-   This point-based information provides valuable insights into ecosystem dynamics.

## Defining a Point Process

-   Consider a fixed geographical region $A$.

-   The set of locations at which events occur are denoted by $\mathbf{s} = (\mathbf{s}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{s}_n)$.

-   A point process is defined by a random variable $N(A)$ that counts the number of events in every subset of the region of interest $A$.

-   Our primary interest is in measuring where events occur, so the **locations are our data**.

## Homogeneous Poisson Process {.smaller}

::: {style="height: 50px;"}
:::

-   The simplest version of a point process model is the homogeneous Poisson process (HPP).

-   The likelihood of a point pattern $\mathbf{y} = \left[ \mathbf{s}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{s}_n \right]^\intercal$ distributed as a HPP with intensity $\lambda$ and observation window $\Omega$ is

    $$
    p(\mathbf{y} | \lambda) \propto \lambda^n e^{ \left( - |\Omega| \lambda \right)} ,
    $$

    -   $|\Omega|$ is the size of the observation window.

    -   $\lambda$ is the expected number of points per unit area.

    -   $|\Omega|\lambda$ the total expected number of points in the observation window.

::: {style="height: 50px;"}
:::

-   A key property of a Poisson process is that the number of points within a region $A$ is Poisson distributed with constant rate $|A|\lambda$.

## Inhomogeneous Poisson process

The *inhomogeneous Poisson process* has a spatially varying intensity $\lambda(\mathbf{s})$.

The likelihood in this case is

$$
p(\mathbf{y} | \lambda) \propto \exp \left( -\int_\Omega \lambda(\mathbf{s}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{s} \right) \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda(\mathbf{s}_i).
$$

-   If the case of an HPP the integral in the likelihood can easily be computed as $\int_\Omega \lambda(\mathbf{s}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{s} =|\Omega|\lambda$

-   For IPP, integral in the likelihood has to be approximated numerically as a weighted sum.

## Inhomogeneous Poisson process

The integral in is approximated as $\sum_{j=1}^J w_j \lambda(\mathbf{s}_j)$

-   $w_j$ are the integration weights

-   $\mathbf{s}_j$ are the quadrature locations.

This serves two purposes:

1.  Approximates the integral

2.  re-write the inhomogeneous Poisson process likelihood as a regular Poisson likelihood.

## Inhomogeneous Poisson process {.smaller}

The idea behind the trick to rewrite the approximate likelihood is to introduce a dummy vector $\mathbf{z}$ and an integration weights vector $\mathbf{w}$ of length $J + n$

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
$$\mathbf{z} = \left[\underbrace{0_1, \ldots,0_J}_\text{quadrature locations}, \underbrace{1_1, \ldots ,1_n}_{\text{data points}} \right]^\intercal$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
$$\mathbf{w} = \left[ \underbrace{w_1, \ldots, w_J}_\text{quadrature locations}, \underbrace{0_1, \ldots, 0_n}_\text{data points} \right]^\intercal$$
:::
:::::

Then the approximate likelihood can be written as

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\mathbf{z} | \lambda) &\propto \prod_{i=1}^{J + n} \eta_i^{z_i} \exp\left(-w_i \eta_i \right) \\
\eta_i &= \log\lambda(\mathbf{s}_i) = \mathbf{x}(s)'\beta
\end{aligned}
$$

-   This is similar to a product of Poisson distributions with means $\eta_i$, exposures $w_i$ and observations $z_i$.

-   This is the basis for the implementation of Cox process models in `inlabru`, which can be specified using `family = "cp"`.

## Limitations with IPP

::: {style="height: 50px;"}
:::

::: incremental
-   IPP models assume that data points are conditionally independent given the covariates, meaning that any spatial variation is fully explained by environmental and sampling factors.
-   Unmeasured endogenous and exogenous factors can create spatial
-   Ignoring them can lead to bias in our conclusions.
:::

## The Log-Gaussian Cox Process {.smaller}

::: {style="height: 50px;"}
:::

-   Log-Gaussian Cox processes (LGCP) extends the IPP by allowing the intensity function to vary spatially according to a structured spatial random effect.

$$
\log~\lambda(s)= \mathbf{x}(s)'\beta + \xi(s)
$$

-   The events are then assumed to be independent given $\xi(s)$ - a GMRF with Matérn covariance.

-   `inlabru` has implemented some integration schemes that are especially well suited to integrating the intensity in models with an SPDE effect.

::: aside

:::

## Gaussian Random Fields {auto-animate="true"}

If we have a process that is occurring everywhere in space, it is natural to try to model it using some sort of function.

-   If $z$ is a vector of observations of $z(\mathbf{s})$ at different locations, we want this to be normally distributed:

$$
\mathbf{z} = (z(\mathbf{s}_1),\ldots,z(\mathbf{s}_m)) \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)
$$

where $\Sigma_{ij} = \mathrm{Cov}(z(\mathbf{s}_i),z(\mathbf{s}_j))$ is a dense $m \times m$ matrix.

## Gaussian Random Fields {auto-animate="true"}

-   A Gaussian random field (GRF) is a collection of random variables where observations occur in a continuous domain, and where every finite collection of random variables has a multivariate normal distribution

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Stationary random fields

A GRF is **stationary** if:

-   has mean zero.

-   the covariance between two points depends only on the distance and direction between those points.

It is **isotropic** if the covariance only depends on the distance between the points.
:::

## The SPDE approach

**The goal**: approximate the GRF using a triangulated mesh via the so-called SPDE approach.

The SPDE approach represents the continuous spatial process as a discretely indexed Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF)

-   We construct an appropriate lower-resolution approximation of the surface by sampling it in a set of well designed points and constructing a piecewise linear interpolant.

![](figures/spde.png){fig-align="center" width="520"}

## The SPDE approach

-   A GF with Matérn covariance $c_{\nu}(d;\sigma,\rho)$ is a solution to a particular PDE.

$$
c_{\nu}(d;\sigma,\rho) = \sigma^2\frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)}\left(\sqrt{8\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\right)^{\nu}K_{\nu}\left(\sqrt{8\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\right)
$$

-   This solution is then approximated using a finite combination of piecewise linear basis functions defined on a triangulation .
-   The solution is completely defined by a Gaussian vector of weights (defined on the triangulation vertices) with zero mean and a sparse precision matrix.
-   How do we choose sensible priors for $\sigma,\rho$?

## Penalized Complexity (PC) priors

Penalized Complexity (PC) priors proposed by Simpson et al. ([2017](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-32/issue-1/Penalising-Model-Component-Complexity--A-Principled-Practical-Approach-to/10.1214/16-STS576.full)) allow us to control the amount of spatial smoothing and avoid overfitting.

-   PC priors shrink the model towards a simpler baseline unless the data provide strong evidence for a more complex structure.
-   To define the prior for the marginal precision $\sigma^{-2}$ and the range parameter $\rho$, we use the probability statements:
    -   Define the prior for the range $\text{Prob}(\rho<\rho_0) = p_{\rho}$
    -   Define the prior for the range $\text{Prob}(\sigma>\sigma_0) = p_{\sigma}$

## SPDE models

We call spatial Markov models defined on a mesh SPDE models.

SPDE models have 3 parts

1.  A mesh

2.  A range parameter $\kappa$

3.  A precision parameter $\tau$

::: incremental
-   We use the SPDE effect to model the intensity of a point process that represents the locations of animal sightings.

-   Often such sightings are made by observers who cannot detect all the animals

-   To accurately estimate abundance, we require an estimate of the number of animals that remained **undetected**.
:::

# Thinned Point Process

## Thinned Point Process {.smaller}

::: {style="height: 50px;"}
:::

The LGCP is a flexible approach that can include spatial covariates to model the mean intensity and a mean-zero spatially structured random effect to account for unexplained heterogeneity not captured by the covariates.

-   To account for the imperfect detection of points we specify a thinning probability function $$g(s) = \mathbb{P}(\text{a point at s is detected}|\text{a point is at s})$$

-   A key property of LGCP is that a realisation of a point process with intensity $\lambda(s)$ that is thinned by probability function $g(s)$, follows also a LGCP with intensity:

$$
\underbrace{\tilde{\lambda}(s)}_{\text{observed process}} = \underbrace{\lambda(s)}_{\text{true process}} \times \underbrace{g(s)}_{\text{thinning probability}}
$$

-   Standard distance sampling approaches specify $g(s)$ as a function that declines with increasing distance
    -   horizontal distance to the observer for *point transects*
    -   perpendicular distance to the transect line for *line transects*
-   The thinning probability function is specified as a parametric family of functions.
-   The thinned-LGCP likelihood is given by:

$$

-   To make $g(s)$ and $\lambda(s)$ identifiable, we assume intensity is constant with respect to distance from the observer.

    -   In practice this means we assume animals are uniformly distributed with respect to distance from the line

## Putting all the pieces together {.smaller}

-   If the strips width ( $2W$ ) is narrow compared to study region ($\Omega$) we can treat them as lines.

-   Define the Poisson process likelihood along the kronecker spaces (line $\times$ distance)

-   Accounting for imperfect detection the thinned Poisson process model on (space, distance) along the transects becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \tilde{\lambda}(s,\text{distance}) &= \overbrace{\mathbf{x}'\beta + \xi(s)}^{\log \lambda(s)} + \log \mathbb{P}(\text{detection at }s|\text{distance},\sigma) + \log(2)\\
\mathbb{P}(\text{detection}) &=1-\exp\left(-\frac{\sigma}{\text{distance}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

::: incremental
-   Here $\log 2$ accounts for the two-sided detection.

-   Typically $\mathbb{P}(distance)$ is a non-linear function, that is where `inlabru` can help via a **Fixed point iteration scheme** (further details available in this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/inlabru/vignettes/method.html))

-   we define $\log (\sigma)$ as a latent Gaussian variable and iteratively linearise it.

## Example: Dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico {.smaller}

In the next example, we will explore data from a combination of several NOAA shipboard surveys conducted on pan-tropical spotted dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico.

-   A total of 47 observations of groups of dolphins were detected. The group size was recorded, as well as the Beaufort sea state at the time of the observation.

-   Transect width is 16 km, i.e. maximal detection distance 8 km (transect half-width 8 km).

```

## Step 1: Define the SPDE representation: The mesh {.smaller auto-animate="true" background-color="#FFFFFF"}

First, we need to create the mesh used to approximate the random field. We can either:

1.  Create a nonconvex extension of the points using the `fm_mesh_2d` and `fm_nonconvex_hull` functions from the `fmesher` package:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(fmesher)

boundary0 = fm_nonconvex_hull(mexdolphin$points,convex = -0.1)

mesh_0 = fm_mesh_2d(boundary = boundary0,
                          max.edge = c(30, 150), # The largest allowed triangle edge length.
                          cutoff = 15,
                          crs = fm_crs(mexdolphin$points))

## Step 1: Define the SPDE representation: The mesh

::: incremental
-   All random field models need to be discretised for practical calculations.

-   The SPDE models were developed to provide a consistent model definition across a range of discretisations.

-   We use finite element methods with local, piecewise linear basis functions defined on a triangulation of a region of space containing the domain of interest.

-   Deviation from stationarity is generated near the boundary of the region.

-   The choice of region and choice of triangulation affects the numerical accuracy.
:::

## Step 1: Define the SPDE representation: The mesh

-   Too fine meshes $\rightarrow$ heavy computation

-   Too coarse mesh $\rightarrow$ not accurate enough

![](figures/mesh_res.png){fig-align="center"}

## Step 1: Define the SPDE representation: The mesh

**Some guidelines**

-   Create triangulation meshes with `fm_mesh_2d()`:

-   edge length should be around a third to a tenth of the spatial range

-   Move undesired boundary effects away from the domain of interest by extending to a smooth external boundary:

-   Use a coarser resolution in the extension to reduce computational cost (`max.edge=c(inner, outer)`), i.e., add extra, larger triangles around the border

## Step 1: Define the SPDE representation: The mesh

-   Use a fine resolution (subject to available computational resources) for the domain of interest (inner correlation range) and avoid small edges ,i.e., filter out small input point clusters (0 $<$ `cutoff` $<$ inner)

-   Coastlines and similar can be added to the domain specification in `fm_mesh_2d()` through the `boundary` argument.

-   simplify the border

## Step 1: Define the SPDE representation: The SPDE {background-color="#FFFFFF"}

We use the `inla.spde2.pcmatern` to define the SPDE model using PC priors through the following probability statements

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   $P(\rho < 50) = 0.1$

-   $P(\sigma > 2) = 0.1$

spde_model =  inla.spde2.pcmatern(
  mexdolphin$mesh,
  prior.sigma = c(2, 0.1),
  prior.range = c(50, 0.1)
)
```

dens_prior_range = function(rho_0, p_alpha)
{
  # compute the density of the PC prior for the
  # range rho of the Matern field
  # rho_0 and p_alpha are defined such that
  # P(rho<rho_0) = p_alpha
  rho = seq(0, rho_0*10, length.out =100)
  alpha1_tilde = -log(p_alpha) * rho_0
  dens_rho =  alpha1_tilde / rho^2 * exp(-alpha1_tilde / rho)
  return(data.frame(x = rho, y = dens_rho))
}

dens_prior_sd = function(sigma_0, p_sigma)
{
  # compute the density of the PC prior for the
  # sd sigma of the Matern field
  # sigma_0 and p_sigma are defined such that
  # P(sigma>sigma_0) = p_sigma
  sigma = seq(0, sigma_0*5, length.out =100)
  alpha2_tilde = -log(p_sigma)/sigma_0
  dens_sigma = alpha2_tilde* exp(-alpha2_tilde * sigma) 
  return(data.frame(x = sigma, y = dens_sigma))

ggplot() + geom_line(data = dens_prior_range(50,.1), aes(x,y))+ labs(y="",x="range",title="Prior for the range") +
ggplot() + geom_line(data = dens_prior_sd(1,.1), aes(x,y)) + labs(y="",x="sd",title="Prior for the sd")

```

## Step 2: Define the Detection function {.smaller background-color="#FFFFFF"}

We start by plotting the distances and histogram of frequencies in distance intervals.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 3.5
#| fig-width: 4
W <- 8
ggplot(mexdolphin$points) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = distance),
    breaks = seq(0, W, length.out = 9),
    boundary = 0, fill = NA, color = "black"
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(x = distance), y = 0, pch = "|", cex = 4)

```

Then, we need to define a half-normal detection probability function. This must take distance as its first argument and the linear predictor of the sigma parameter as its second:

```{r}
# define detection function
hn <- function(distance, sigma) {
  exp(-0.5 * (distance / sigma)^2)
}
```

::: notes
The samplers in this dataset are lines, not polygons, so we need to tell `inlabru` about the strip half-width, W, which in the case of these data is 8.

To control the prior distribution for the $\sigma$ parameter, we use a transformation mapper that converts a latent variable into an exponentially distributed variable with expectation 8

The `marginal` argument in the sigma component specifies the transformation function taking N(0,1) to Exponential(1/8).

To map the spatial intensity we first need to define a grid of points where we want to predict.

-   We do this using the function `fm_pixel()` which creates a regular grid of points covering the mesh
-   Then, we use the `predict` function which takes as input
    -   the fitted model (`fit`)
    -   the prediction points (`pxl`)
    -   the model components we want to predict (e.g., $e^{\beta_0 + \xi(s)}$)
-   To plot this you can use `ggplot` and add a `gg()` layer with your output of interest (E.g., `pr.int$spatial`)

How many would be seen under perfect detection across the whole study area (i.e., the **mean** expected number of dolphins)?

```{r}
predpts <- fm_int(mexdolphin$mesh, mexdolphin$ppoly)
Lambda <- predict(fit, predpts, ~ sum(weight * exp(space + Intercept)))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
Lambda %>%  gt() %>% fmt_number()
```

## Results: predicted expected counts {.smaller background-color="#FFFFFF"}

What’s the predictive distribution of group counts?

We can also get Monte Carlo samples for the expected number of dolphins as follows:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
Ns <- seq(50, 450, by = 1)

Nest <- predict(fit, predpts,
  ~ data.frame(
    N = Ns,
    density = dpois(
      Ns,
      lambda = sum(weight * exp(space + Intercept))
    )
  ),
  n.samples = 2000
)

Nest <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  cbind(Nest, Method = "Posterior"),
  data.frame(
    N = Nest$N,
    mean = dpois(Nest$N, lambda = Lambda$mean),
    mean.mc_std_err = 0,
    Method = "Plugin"
  )
)
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-height: 8
ggplot(data = Nest) +
  geom_line(aes(x = N, y = mean, colour = Method)) +
  geom_ribbon(
    aes(
      x = N,
      ymin = mean - 2 * mean.mc_std_err,
      ymax = mean + 2 * mean.mc_std_err,
      fill = Method,
    ),
    alpha = 0.2
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(x = N, y = mean, colour = Method)) +
  ylab("Probability mass function")
